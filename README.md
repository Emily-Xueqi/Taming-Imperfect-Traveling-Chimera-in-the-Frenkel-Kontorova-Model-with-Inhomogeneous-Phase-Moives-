# Taming Imperfect Traveling Chimera in the Frenkel-Kontorova Model with Inhomogeneous Phase (Movies) 
We have shown typical patterns of the dynamics of the Frenkel-Kontorova mode in the form of animations. The animation of the snapshot of particles is shown in the 2D plane, where on the horizontal axis the number of units is marked (with the particles by 1–128), while on the vertical axis their speeds are given. These results correspond to the ones shown in the form of snapshots in Fig. 3 (left panel). On the other hand, The animation of spatiotemporal pattern one can observe the animation of oscillating particles, where on the horizontal axis the evolutionary time is marked, while on the vertical axis the number of units is given (with the particles by 1–128). The color bar represents the speed of oscillation of the particles. All animations have been produced using PYTHON software.
